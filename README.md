# Bunary Documentation

This repo holds the documentation site source. **Guides** (`guides/`) are authored here. **Package reference docs** are authored in each package repo under `docs/`; the files under `packages/` in this repo are **synced output** from those package repos (do not edit `packages/*.md` directly).

## Source of truth

- **Guides:** Authored in this repo under `guides/`.
- **Package docs:** Source of truth is each package repo’s `docs/` (e.g. `bunary-dev/core`, `bunary-dev/http`, …). This repo’s `packages/*.md` are generated by `bun run sync:packages` from those sources.
- **Details:** See [PACKAGE_DOCS_CONTRACT.md](./PACKAGE_DOCS_CONTRACT.md) (structure, README vs docs/) and [PUBLISH_WORKFLOW.md](./PUBLISH_WORKFLOW.md) (when and how to run sync).

## Where to edit

- **Package reference docs:** Edit in the package repo under `docs/` (e.g. `bunary-dev/core`, `bunary-dev/http`), then run `bun run sync:packages` here and commit updated `packages/*.md`.
- **Guides:** Edit files under `guides/` in this repo.
- **Do not edit** `packages/*.md` directly (they are synced output).

## Building Documentation

All build/sync scripts live in this repo and are run from the documentation repo root (e.g. `cd documentation && bun run …`).

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| `bun run sync:packages` | Fetch package `docs/index.md` from GitHub and write `packages/*.md` in this repo. |
| `bun run sync:site` | Build guides + packages markdown into React components for the site. Cleans the site docs output dir, then generates. |
| `bun run sync` | Run `sync:packages` then `sync:site` (full pipeline). |

### sync:packages

Package documentation is authored in each package repo under `docs/` and synced into this repo under `packages/`.

```bash
bun run sync:packages
```

This will update:
- `packages/core.md`
- `packages/http.md`
- `packages/auth.md`
- `packages/orm.md`
- `packages/cli.md`

### CI drift check

Pull requests are expected to keep `packages/*.md` in sync. CI will fail if `bun run sync:packages` produces changes that are not committed.

Review checklist (contract, per-package alignment, guides): [DOCS_REVIEW.md](./DOCS_REVIEW.md).

### sync:site (build docs for site)

Reads `guides/` and `packages/` in this repo and writes React components to the site docs directory.

- **Default output:** `../site/src/pages/docs` (when run from this repo, assumes site is a sibling directory).
- **Custom output:** set `DOCS_SITE_OUTPUT` to the absolute path of the site’s docs folder (e.g. when the site is in a different repo).

```bash
bun run sync:site
# Or with a custom site path:
DOCS_SITE_OUTPUT=/path/to/site/src/pages/docs bun run sync:site
```

The script clears the output directory (except `DocsLayout.tsx`) before generating, so each run leaves only the current docs.

## Writing Documentation

### Guides

- Use standard Markdown syntax
- Code blocks should specify language: ` ```typescript `
- Use frontmatter for metadata (title, description, etc.)
- Keep documentation focused and example-driven

### Package Documentation

- Package reference content is authored in each package repo under `docs/` and synced into this repo as `packages/*.md` (do not edit those files directly).
- To change package docs: edit in the package repo, then run `bun run sync:packages` here and commit. See [PACKAGE_DOCS_CONTRACT.md](./PACKAGE_DOCS_CONTRACT.md) and [PUBLISH_WORKFLOW.md](./PUBLISH_WORKFLOW.md).
